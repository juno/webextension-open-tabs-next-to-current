Open Tabs Next To Current
=========================

Open tabs that would normally be opened last next to the current one. Tabs that
are being re-opened are thus not included.  You can use `Ctrl-Y`
(`Ctrl-Shift-Y` on Windows) to open a new tab at the default location.

Note for Chrome
---------------

Keyboard shortcuts are not automatically set up. You need to do that manually
on the extension page in settings.

Note for Firefox
----------------

After the addition of the `browser.tabs.insertAfterCurrent` setting in
`about:config` you do not need this extension anymore.

Known Issues
------------

Caused by limitations of the webextension API, see
[#26](https://github.com/sblask/webextension-open-tabs-next-to-current/issues/26)
and
[#29](https://github.com/sblask/webextension-open-tabs-next-to-current/issues/29):

 - tabs are visibly moved to their final position
 - the tab bar is scrolled so the opened tab becomes the first visible one on
   the left (Firefox only) - you can set `browser.tabs.tabMinWidth` in
   `about:config` to something low like `20` so the tab bar is not scrollable
   at all
 - when opening multiple tabs at once, only one of them is opened at the right
   position

Privacy Policy
